                    <p> Luke Harrison is a young and ambitious computer expert with a passion 
			for technology that began at the age of 6. With 14 years of experience,
			he has honed his skills in building and fixing computers, ranging from top-of-the-line
			systems to less advanced machines. This has led him to assist his father in a successful
			side hustle business, where he has built and repaired over 75 machines. </p>
                            <br>
		    <p> In addition to his technical expertise, Luke is a highly competitive gamer, having achieved top rankings
			in multiple games such as Fortnite Battle Royale, Rainbow 6 Siege, and Apex Legends. He has
			consistently placed in the top 0.2% of players in Europe and the world, demonstrating his
			ability to perform under pressure and achieve his goals. </p>
                            <br>
		    <p> Luke also excels in creative pursuits, with fluency in the Adobe Suite and proficiency in
			multiple programming languages including Python, C++, C#, C, JavaScript, Node.js, Java, and
			YASM assembly language. He is also comfortable working with a variety of operating systems
			including MacOS, Linux, and Windows. Through a college placement at FabLab, he has also gained
			valuable skills in 3D printing, laser cutting, vinyl cutting, CNC milling, and woodworking.

			Luke continues to expand his knowledge and expertise in the field. </p>
                             <br>
            <p> My 7 years of experience with the British Theatre Dance Association, commencing from a young
                age of 6, has polished my discipline, focus, and capacity to perform under pressure. These attributes,
                honed through years of competitive dance, not only make me a proficient dancer but also translate well to
                the field of computing, which I am currently pursuing as a career.</p>
